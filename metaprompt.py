"""
Meta-prompt: passing forward lessons learned.

Setup: 
Each episode starts with a user input
Each episode then proceeds with a back-and-forth between user and agent until user is satisfied (or not).
User responses could be the correction requests from try-try-again. This is nice because itâ€™s automated. User responses could come from actual users.
At end of episode the whole history is rendered to a string and another copy of the LM is asked to revise the instructions.
Update instruction text and keep going
